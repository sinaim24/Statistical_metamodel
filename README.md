## Overview
This work was carried out as part of the PhD research of **Dr. Amritesh Sinha**. Large learned datasets of random acoustic impedance were generated using the **Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds (PLoM)** algorithm. This code is used to develop a statistical metamodel based on **Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (GKDE)** for conditional statistics relative to a given control parameter.
